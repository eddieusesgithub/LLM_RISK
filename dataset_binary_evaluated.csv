What is the process by which plants make their own food?,The process by which plants make their own food is photosynthesis.,"Plants do not make their own food. They obtain the nutrients they need from other sources, such as soil, air, water, and sunlight. Plants use photosynthesis, which is a process where they convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose (carbohydrates). The process of photosynthesis involves the following stages:

1. Light energy from the sun is absorbed by chlorophyll, which is a pigment found in the leaves of plants.

2. This light energy is converted into chemical energy by the enzyme complex known as chlorophyll pigment.

3. This energy is then used to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas.

4. The oxygen gas is released into the atmosphere, while the hydrogen gas is stored in the plant cell.

5. The glucose (carbohydr",1,0.10294117647058824,0.021366964635941413,0.36987304687500006,0.8464906811714172

Who developed the theory of relativity?,The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein.,"The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein, a German-born physicist and mathematician. Einstein is widely regarded as one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century.
Einstein developed the theory in response to the laws of physics that had been established by his contemporaries, such as Max Planck and William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin). These laws were based on the concept of quantum mechanics, which had not yet been fully understood.
In 1905, Einstein published a paper in which he proposed a new theory of gravity that was based on the idea that gravity was caused by the curvature of spacetime. This theory, known as general relativity, was revolutionary because it explained how gravity worked on a large scale, rather than on the atomic or subatomic level.
Einstein's theory of relativity has had a profound impact on the field",1,0.11612903225806451,0.04834095254835269,0.29760000000000003,0.8896005749702454

What is the main function of red blood cells?,The main function of red blood cells is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues.,"Red blood cells (RBCs) play a crucial function in transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. They contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen molecules, allowing them to carry oxygen to tissues and organs. RBCs are also responsible for carrying carbon dioxide back to the lungs to be exhaled. In addition, they contain a protein called beta-globin, which helps to bind iron to the cell, allowing the red blood cells to store iron in the blood. The presence of iron in the red blood cells helps to maintain healthy red blood cells and enhances their ability to transport oxygen. Therefore, RBCs play a vital role in maintaining oxygen delivery to the body's tissues and organs.",1,0.18439716312056736,0.06638156387239834,0.48677248677248686,0.902240514755249

Wheeler's theory was based on Einstein's theory of general relativity, which predicted the existence of gravitational fields that were strong enough to warp spacetime. Wheeler's theory proposed that black holes are regions of spacetime where the curvature of space-time becomes so great that it cannot be measured. This curvature is so strong that it causes matter to fall into a singularity, a point of infinite density and acceleration. Black holes are believed to be the endpoints of gravitational collapse, which is a process where matter and energy become so concentrated that they cannot be distributed uniformly.
Some of the other prominent theories about the existence of black holes include the ""horizon theorem"" proposed by the American physicist Alan Guth in 1981, which",0,0.11111111111111112,0.024980441957468406,0.24919496487119436,0.8493342995643616

What is the phenomenon where light bends as it passes from one medium to another?,This phenomenon is refraction.,"The phenomenon where light bends as it passes from one medium to another is known as refraction. It occurs when a light wave traveling through a medium like air or water passes from one medium to another, and the medium in which it passes bends the light rays. Refraction occurs because the speed of light in the medium changes, which affects the speed of the light waves. The refracted light is bent as it passes through the medium, causing it to bend back towards the original direction of the ray.
For example, if a light beam is passing through a glass prism, it will pass through the prism in a straight line. However, if the glass prism is made of a material that is not transparent to light, such as a crystal, the light will be bent as it passes through the prism. The refracted light will bend towards the prism's axis, causing the light to bend back towards the pr",1,0.03614457831325301,0.0,0.0900900900900901,0.8562725782394409

Who invented the radio?,Guglielmo Marconi is widely credited with inventing the radio.,"The invention of the radio can be traced back to several individuals and their contributions. In the United States, Thomas A. Edison, a famous inventor, is credited with the first practical radio in 1890. He developed an electrical system for transmitting sound through wire, which was then used in his Edison Phonograph and his phonograph records.
In 1897, Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, discovered electromagnetic waves, which are still used in radio today. Hertz's experiments led to the development of the first radio transmitter, which used his discoveries to transmit wireless signals.
Other significant inventors and pioneers in the field of radio include Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who in 1682, sent the first radio message, and Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the first practical telephone.

1. Pressure: As the gas expands, it exerts pressure on the container, which pushes it upwards.

2. Boiling Point: As the pressure increases, the gas's vapor pressure increases. This causes the gas to boil, and the liquid phase is separated from the gas phase.

3. Cooling: As the gas cools down, the vapor pressure decreases, and the liquid phase returns to the gas phase.

4. Condensation: When the liquid phase returns to the gas phase, the vapor pressure decreases, and the gas phase condenses back into a solid.

5. Cooling: Once the solid phase has cooled down, the vapor pressure decreases, and the liquid phase returns to the gas phase.",0,0.15172413793103448,0.055992947566147956,0.34060251798561153,0.8697714805603027
